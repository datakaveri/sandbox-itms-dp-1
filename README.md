# Data Anonymization via Differential Privacy

## This notebook provides access to the implementation of the widely accepted privacy preserving technique of differential privacy. 

## Differential privacy has been implemented on the Transit Management System data where the user can have access to the useful aggregate statistics such as average speed and number of speed limit violations of a vehicle  in such a way that the privacy of individual driver records is not compromised.

## The tools and techniques implemented in the notebook can be extended for a general spatio-temporal database where space is quantized into hexagonal regions and time of day is quantized into time-slots.

## The interactive python notebook can be accessed and executed via Sandox: https://sandbox.iudx.org.in/

## A report describing the definitions, feature, and algorithms on differential privacy is contained in the file DP_ITMS_Report.docx (in the docs subfolder)
